### If/Else Statements
If statements only activate when a certain condition is met, the condition should be written in () and should equate to true or false.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("What is the magic word?");
string a = Console.ReadLine()
if(a == "Hi")
{
  Console.WriteLine("You know the magic word!");
}
else
{
  Console.WriteLine("You don't know the magic word");
}
Console.ReadLine();
```
