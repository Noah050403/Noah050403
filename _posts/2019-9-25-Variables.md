Variables are used to store pieces of data such as an integer or a string. Unlike python, C# requires you to declare which type of data the varibale will contain.
This can be done like this.
```csharp
string words = "This is a string.";
int number = 10;
double decimal = 1.5;
char letter = "A";
bool True = true;
```
